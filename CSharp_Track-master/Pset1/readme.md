## PROGRAMMING
1. You're tasked with creating some software that should be able to calculate the area of a rectangle. Write a single function that accepts 2 integer parameters and return the calculated area as an integer. In your Main function, call your area function passing in same sample data to test that your function works. You will be required to print the result of your calculation to the screen.
2. Multiplication tables are fundamental to mathematics. Write a function that accepts a single integer, int n for example, and prints out a n x n multiplication table. For example, if I call your function with the parameter 5, then I expect to see a table printed that looks like the following.
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 10
3 6 9 12 15
4 8 12 16 20
5 10 15 20 25

3. Write a function called Max that accepts a variable number of integer parameters. Find the largest number in the collection and return it from your Max function.
4. Your boss has decided to give everyone in your company a raise. Your job is to write a function for the HR system that will take a list of everyone's salaries and increase it by 10 percent. Your function should return a new list of updated salaries.
## BLOG
Write a short blog post about the similarities that you've seen between programming in C and C#. Try to show at least 3 similarities and don't forget to include some code samples to help visualize your points.
## RESEARCH
The C# programming language is just one of the componenets that make up the .NET ecosystem. Spend some time investigating what exactly is .NET and how does it compares to other software development platforms. You should be able to briefly explain what the CLR, Garbage collector, and BCL do.
