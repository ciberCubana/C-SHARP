## Programming
Big Bank Inc. is getting ready to open up in Miami. However, they need some software that will help them do some basic customer account management. Your job is to create a simple console application that will provide some value to their workflow. Your application should be able to do the following:

Create new accounts and remove accounts. Users should be able to choose between Savings or Checking accounts. Savings accounts should have an associated fixed interest rate at 1.5%.
Each account should have a customer. Customers can be associated with more than one account. 
Users should be able to deposit or withdraw funds from an individual account.
Users should be able to find out the total amount of funds in the bank, i.e. the total sum of the funds in all of the accounts in the bank.
Users should be able to view the accounts details of an account they select

You will need to provide the bank users with a menu that they can use to to carry out the various tasks.  When your applications starts, a list of options should be displayed to the users, after which they should be prompted for a their choice. Based on that, you should update the accounts accordingly. Below is an example of what the menu might look like.

1 -  Create an account
2- Make a deposit
3- Withdraw Funs
4 - Quit

## Bonus:
If you have the time and want to take on a challenge, then try to complete this. Upgrade the application to read and store the customer account information into a plain text file. It's fine if you don't get this to work, but make sure the main assignment still runs.


## Blog
In the last few classes we’ve been talking about Object Oriented Programming in C#. More specifically, we’ve discussed topics such as classes, inheritance and polymorphism. Write a blog post that explains what the abstract, override and virtual keywords are used for in C#. In addition to your explanation, you will be required to include code samples in your blog post.
